Hi there!

My name is Nicolas and I'm just about to finish my Bachelor's in CS at ETH Zurich. 

I enjoy reading, riddles, music and maths.

Feel free to reach out, I always like talking to curious minds and I'm happy to help.

Next semester (Spring 2025) I'll be working full-time at an asset manager and 
thus not be as active as previously.
